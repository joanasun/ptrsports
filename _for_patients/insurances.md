Please contact your insurance plan for detailed benefits and coverage questions.  In general we are a standard PPO provider.  We do our best to identify any out of network plans and inform our patients at the time of receipt, however it is ultimately  the members responsibility to verify with their specific plan if PTR Sports is in their network.  Please advise that Jeffrey Blue, MD is the billing provider for all PTR Sports providers.  Travel insurances are no longer accepted by our office due to the numerous forms that need to be filled out by members.  We find that this rarely takes place and therefore travel insurance members will have to pay for there visit and seek reimbursement directly from their insurance carrier.
