  <h2>Medical Practice</h2>
</header>

We see patients for both family medicine and sports medicine, from age 3 to 103. Many of our patients are athletes, former athletes, or future athletes, and take an active role in their health. As such, we try to incorporate the disciplines of sports medicine – thinking right, exercise, nutrition, and medicine – into our practice in order to make you healthier and better.

Choosing a physician is a very personal matter. We think you will like who we are, where we practice, and how we deliver care. We expect to exceed your highest expectations.

Our physical therapy department is a key part of your success as a recovering athlete. Our programs are hands-on and individualized to your injury. We expect you to improve and get better and will push you to do so as fast as you are able. Our physical therapy rehabilitation modalities may include manual therapy, infrared light, ultrasound therapy, iontophoresis/phontophoresis, mechanical traction, vasopneumatic compression, hot/cold therapy, parrafin and a tailored home exercise program, amongst others.
