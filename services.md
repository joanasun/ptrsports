  <h2>Medical Practice</h2>
</header>

We see patients for both family medicine and sports medicine, from age 3 to 103. Many of our patients are athletes, former athletes, or future athletes, and take an active role in their health. As such, we try to incorporate the disciplines of sports medicine – thinking right, exercise, nutrition, and medicine – into our practice in order to make you healthier and better.

Choosing a physician is a very personal matter. We think you will like who we are, where we practice, and how we deliver care. We expect to exceed your highest expectations.

  <h2>Physical Therapy</h2>
</header>

Physical therapy at PTR Sports is unlike any other. You will find that our programs are hands-on and individualized more than other therapy. We expect you to improve and get better and will push you to do so as fast as you are able. Set your expectations high and we will exceed them.

  <h2>Chiropractic</h2>
</header>

Our chiropractic care is not your normal visit to the chiropractor. Along with your initial evaluation, we use traditional and modern chiropractic techniques to not only fix the issue temporarily, but to correct the problem for the long run. Along with manual treatments, corrective exercises are given to use as daily tools to hopefully prevent you from reoccurring injuries.
