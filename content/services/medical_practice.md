We see patients for both family medicine and sports medicine, from age 3 to 103. Many of our patients are athletes, former athletes, or future athletes, and take an active role in their health. As such, we try to incorporate the disciplines of sports medicine – thinking right, exercise, nutrition, and medicine – into our practice in order to make you healthier and better.

Choosing a physician is a very personal matter. We think you will like who we are, where we practice, and how we deliver care. We expect to exceed your highest expectations.

Call us today at (408) 404-4700 to schedule an appointment.
