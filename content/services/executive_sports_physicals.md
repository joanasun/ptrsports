Our office is authorized by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to perform immigration medical examinations. This immigration physical is required when applying for a green card in the United States. The cost of this exam through our office is $275 - this includes the physical exam and tuberculosis screening. Insurance policies do not cover this exam. Any additional vaccines needed are not included in this cost; those vaccines can either be paid for out of pocket, through your insurance, or obtained at a separate facility as long as valid documentation is provided to us. 

What to Bring to the exam

Bring the following to your medical exam:

Form I-693, Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record

Government-issued photo identification, such as a valid passport or driver’s license. If you are 14 years old or younger, bring identification that shows your name, date and place of birth and parent’s full name. Possible forms of identification include your birth certificate (with an English translation) or an affidavit.

Vaccination or immunization record (such as DT, DTP, DTaP, Td, Tdap, OPV, IPV, MMR, Hib, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, varicella, pneumococcal influenza, rotavirus and meningococcal disease)

Medical insurance card (check with the doctor’s office to make sure the office accepts your medical plan)

Payment (check with the doctor’s office about acceptable forms of payment). It is also a good idea to call a few doctors to find out how much they charge for the exam. Prices can vary by a few hundred dollars.

During the Exam

The doctor will test for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, syphilis, and gonorrhea (syphilis and gonorrhea are only applicable if the applicant is over the age of 15). The tuberculosis test is done in two parts. You will have to return to the doctor’s office within two to three days to have the results read. The syphilis test is a blood test, and the gonorrhea test is a urine test. The syphilis and gonorrhea tests are done at a separate facility.

The doctor will also check your records to see if you need any vaccinations.

After the exam, we will complete Form I-693 and seal the form in an envelope for you to submit to USCIS. We will also provide a copy of the completed Form I-693 for your personal records in addition to the copy in the sealed envelope. USCIS will not accept the form if the envelope has been opened or altered.
