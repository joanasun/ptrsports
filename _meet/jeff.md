Dr. Blue is our Medical Director and Physician.

He is board certified in family medicine and fellowship trained in sports medicine. He is originally from New Jersey and has a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Tufts University. He worked for four years mostly in software development before attending UMDNJ – New Jersey Medical School. Dr. Blue completed a family medicine residency at UCLA Medical Center and a sports medicine fellowship at The Ohio State University Medical Center.

Dr. Blue has been in private practice since 1998. He previously had offices in San Jose and San Francisco before moving in 2007 to our current location in Santa Clara. He currently is team physician for the San Jose Earthquakes and physician for Cirque du Soleil when they are in San Jose.

His current practice is 50% family medicine and 50% sports medicine.

He uses his sports medicine background to treat all of his patients. Most conditions can be treated by combining the disciplines of sports medicine – exercise, nutrition, medication, and thinking right, and he uses these to educate patients to take control of their medical problems and better their lives.

Dr. Blue played many sports growing-up and currently enjoys running, working-out, and golf, as well as spending time with his family. He currently resides in San Jose.
