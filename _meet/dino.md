Dr. Dino Del Mastro earned his Doctor of Chiropractic Degree from Palmer College of Chiropractic West (PCCW) in San Jose, California.  Dr. Del Mastro chose PCCW because of its prestigious Sports Council Program, which allowed him to study and specialize in Sports Therapy.  In school, he had ample opportunity for hands-on experience in injury evaluation and management while working as an intern at local sporting events.

After graduating from PCCW,  Dr. Del Mastro served as an Associate Doctor working alongside  San Jose State’s Sports Medicine Staff.  Here he also served as the Assistant Team Chiropractor for SJSU’s Football team in their 2010-2011 Season.  In addition to working as a chiropractor and in sports therapy, he likes to stay involved with the fitness industry by working as an instructor for the National Academy of Sports Medicine where he teaches the Corrective Exercise Specialist (CES) and Certified Personal Trainer (CPT) course on weekends.

Dr. Del Mastro also understands what it is like to be injured first-hand.  Throughout high school and college, he competed in the sport of Judo on the national and international level.  During his junior year of college, he suffered an ACL tear while training, sidelining him for six months.  During this time off, his interest grew for understanding the mechanism of his injury and ultimately sports injury prevention.

In his free time Dr. Del Mastro enjoys spending time outside hiking, fishing and camping.  He currently holds the ranking of second-degree black belt in Judo, blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and enjoys staying in shape by training at a local Crossfit gym.
