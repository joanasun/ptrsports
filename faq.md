<h3>What insurances do you accept?</h3>
We advise that patients call their insurance or go to their insurance website to double check that we are in network for their plan. In general, we accept all PPO insurances. Additionally, we are not in network for most Covered CA plans. We do offer cash pay options if necessary. Please call our office if you have any further questions.

<h3>Do you perform immigration physical examinations?</h3>
Yes, we are a designated site for immigration physicals, which is an exam that is required for anybody who applies for lawful permanent resident status. The cost for an immigration physical at our office is $295 per person. This fee is due at the time of initial exam, and covers initial consult visit, PPD placement for tuberculosis screening, PPD read 48-72 hours after placement and follow up visit to finalize forms.

Before coming to the office, please print out and fill out the first page of <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-693.pdf">Form I-693</a> and write your legal name on the top of EVERY page of the form. If you are not able to do this at home, please allow an additional 15-30 minutes to complete this in the office before your appointment.

It is very important that you bring any vaccination records and recent immunization lab work that you have in order to determine which vaccines or labs you may need.  If you do not have any vaccination records we will order labs to determine which vaccines you have immunity to.  Once the results are received from the laboratory, this will determine if any additional vaccines are necessary in order to complete the I-693 process.

Once we have received all of your finalized documentation, you will receive notification to pick up your completed paperwork.  The original copy of the I-693 form and any pertinent records are sealed in an envelope per US Government request.  You will also be provided with a copy of all documentation in order to review for any errors or changes that may need to be made. For additional questions, please contact our office at (408) 404-4700.

<h3>How do I access the patient portal?</h3>
The link to the patient portal is here. When you first register at our office and provide your email address, you will receive an email to register for the portal. If you need that email resent to you, please call the office and we would be happy to assist you. 

<h3>Do you have an imaging center on site?</h3>
There is an Imaging center in the same building as our office, called Santa Clara Imaging Center, but are a separate entity. If they do not accept your insurance there are also different imaging facilities that we refer out to. Ex: Valley Radiology, Premier Scan, etc. If your visit involves ordering an MRI, we require a follow-up office visit to discuss the results. We do not discuss MRI results over the phone. 

<h3>Do you have a lab on site?</h3>
Unfortunately we do not have a lab on site. We do provide lab slips for patients and take to the specific lab that is accepted by your insurance. The most common are LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics. 


<h2>Physical Therapy and Chiropractic</h2>

<h3>Do I need a referral for my physical therapy or chiropractic appointment?</h3>
This is based on your insurance allowance, which varies between plans and insurance providers. We advise you to contact your insurance company prior to scheduling. If your insurance company requires a referral, we would be happy to book you an appointment with one of our medical providers to assess your need for physical therapy. You may also bring a referral from your PCP. 

<h3>What should I bring to my PT or chiropractic appointment?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Referral, if necessary</li>
<li>If it’s your first PT/chiropractic appointment, please bring your insurance card and photo ID</li>
<li>Prior imaging reports</li>
<li>Wear comfortable clothes - bring shorts if you’re being seen for a lower extremity injury</li>
  </ul>

<h3>What can I expect from my first appointment?</h3>
Prior to your first appointment, we call and confirm your insurance benefits. You will be informed of your coverage and out-of-pocket costs when you check-in for your first PT/chiropractic visit. Your first appointment will be longer than subsequent appointments (45 minutes to an hour vs. 30-45 mins). You will be evaluated and treated during your first appointment with our physical therapy or chiropractic team, and you will be provided with a home exercise plan. They will also make recommendations about the frequency and duration for future visits. 

<h3>How long will it take for my injury to heal?</h3>
This is highly variable. Many injuries require patience and persistence to heal completely. Our job is to help your injury heal as quickly as it can, and also to prevent the injury from recurring in the future. 

<h3>How often will I have to come in for my appointments?</h3>
Typically patients see the most benefit when they come in once or twice a week for physical therapy appointments. Most of the work, however, occurs at home on a daily basis as you go through the exercises in your home exercise program and keep your posture/activity modifications in mind. 

<h3>Can I continue working out while undergoing treatment?</h3>
We will discuss modifications to your sport or work out regimen during your physical therapy appointment, if applicable. Many injuries require rest or modification in order to prevent further aggravation to the injury.
